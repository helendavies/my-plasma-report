  abstract = {The measurement of radical densities in atmospheric-pressure plasmas has gained increasing importance in recent years in view of their crucial role in many applications. In this paper we present absolute OH density measurements by broadband UV absorption in diffuse atmospheric-pressure RF glow discharges in mixtures of He and H 2 O. The use of a 310 nm light-emitting diode as a light source and a very high resolution spectrometer (2.6 pm resolution) made the estimation of the total OH density possible by simultaneously measuring the absorption rates of different spectrally resolved rotational lines of the OH( A – X ) transition. For different RF powers and water concentrations, OH densities and gas temperatures ranging between 6 × 10 19 and 4 × 10 20 m −3 and 345 and 410 K, respectively, were obtained. The gas temperature T g was also measured by three different methods. T g deduced from the rotational temperature of N 2 ( C – B ) emission, nitrogen being present as a trace impurity, provided the most reliable value. The rotational temperature T r of the ground state OH( X ) presented values with a maximum deviation of 25 K compared with T g . To obtain the gas temperature from the emission intensities of OH( A – X ) rotational lines, the recorded intensities of different lines must be corrected for the effect of self-absorption inside the plasma.},

  abstract = {Ozone is widely used to disinfect drinking water and wastewater due to its strong biocidal oxidizing properties. Recently, it was reported that hydroxyl radicals (·OH), resulting from ozone decomposition, play a significant role in microbial inactivation when Bacillus subtilis endospores were used as the test microorganisms in pH controlled distilled water. However, it is not yet known how natural organic matter (NOM), which is ubiquitous in sources of drinking water, affects this process of disinfection by ozone-initiated radical reactions. Two types of water matrix were considered for this study. One is water containing humic acid, which is commercially available. The other is water from the Han River. This study reported that hydroxyl radicals, initiated by the ozone chain reaction, were significantly effective at B. subtilis endospore inactivation in water containing NOM, as well as in pH-controlled distilled water. The type of NOM and the pH have a considerable effect on the percentage of disinfection by hydroxyl radicals, which ranged from 20 to 50%. In addition, the theoretical C̅T value of hydroxyl radicals for 2-log B. subtilis removal was estimated to be about 2.4 × 104 times smaller than that of ozone, assuming that there is no synergistic activity between ozone and hydroxyl radicals.},

  abstract = {The biocidal action of the TiO2 photocatalyst has been now well recognized from massive experimental evidences, which demonstrates that the photocatalytic disinfection process could be technically feasible. However, the understanding on the photochemical mechanism of the biocidal action largely remains unclear. In particular, the identity of main acting photooxidants and their roles in the mechanism of killing microorganisms is under active investigation. It is generally accepted that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and \{OH\} radicals play the role. The aim of this study is to determine how the \{OH\} radical, acting either independently or in collaboration with other ROS, is quantitatively related to the inactivation of E. coli. The steady-state concentrations of \{OH\} radicals ([•OH]ss) in UV-illuminated TiO2 suspensions could be quantified from the measured photocatalytic degradation rates of p-chlorobenzoic acid (a probe compound) and its literature bimolecular rate constant with \{OH\} radicals. The results demonstrated an excellent linear correlation between [•OH]ss and the rates of E. coli inactivation, which indicates that the \{OH\} radical is the primary oxidant species responsible for inactivating E. coli in the UV/TiO2 process. The \{CT\} value of \{OH\} radical for achieving 2 log E. coli inactivation was initially found to be 0.8×10−5 mg min/l, as predicted by the delayed Chick–Watson model. Although the primary role of \{OH\} radicals in photocatalytic disinfection processes has been frequently assumed, this is the first quantitative demonstration that the concentration of \{OH\} radicals and the biocidal activity is linearly correlated. },

  abstract = {Endogenous and exogenous sources cause oxidatively induced \{DNA\} damage in living organisms by a variety of mechanisms. The resulting \{DNA\} lesions are mutagenic and, unless repaired, lead to a variety of mutations and consequently to genetic instability, which is a hallmark of cancer. Oxidatively induced \{DNA\} damage is repaired in living cells by different pathways that involve a large number of proteins. Unrepaired and accumulated \{DNA\} lesions may lead to disease processes including carcinogenesis. Mutations also occur in \{DNA\} repair genes, destabilizing the \{DNA\} repair system. A majority of cancer cell lines have somatic mutations in their \{DNA\} repair genes. In addition, polymorphisms in these genes constitute a risk factor for cancer. In general, defects in \{DNA\} repair are associated with cancer. Numerous \{DNA\} repair enzymes exist that possess different, but sometimes overlapping substrate specificities for removal of oxidatively induced \{DNA\} lesions. In addition to the role of \{DNA\} repair in carcinogenesis, recent evidence suggests that some types of tumors possess increased \{DNA\} repair capacity that may lead to therapy resistance. \{DNA\} repair pathways are drug targets to develop \{DNA\} repair inhibitors to increase the efficacy of cancer therapy. Oxidatively induced \{DNA\} lesions and \{DNA\} repair proteins may serve as potential biomarkers for early detection, cancer risk assessment, prognosis and for monitoring therapy. Taken together, a large body of accumulated evidence suggests that oxidatively induced \{DNA\} damage and its repair are important factors in the development of human cancers. Thus this field deserves more research to contribute to the development of cancer biomarkers, \{DNA\} repair inhibitors and treatment approaches to better understand and fight cancer. },

Novel aspects include the primacy of inflammatory processes, within the CNS, which leads to increased formation of âproinflammatoryâ cytokines that lead to increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mediation of the upregulation of genes that produce toxic products such as reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Here I utilize important background reports and synthesize ideas to help account for the noted increases in \{ROS\} and \{RNS\} and their biological reaction products in neurodegenerative diseases. The uniqueness of the \{CNS\} inflammatory processes include minimal damping of amplification processes, such as proinflammatory cytokine-mediated cascades, combined with unique genetic defects, that act in combination with other risk factors to repeatedly âsparkâ the inflammatory cascades to account for some of the major differences in neurodegenerative diseases. This hypothesis can be experimentally examined by development of definitive methods to quantitate unique products that are formed by processes predicted to occur under neurodegenerative conditions. },

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the closely related reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are often generated in applications of atmospheric pressure plasmas intended for biomedical purposes. These species are also central players in what is sometimes referred to as âredoxâ or oxidationâreduction biology. Oxidationâreduction biochemistry is fundamental to all of aerobic biology. ROS and RNS are perhaps best known as disease-associated agents, implicated in diabetes, cancer, heart and lung disease, autoimmune disease and a host of other maladies including ageing and various infectious diseases. These species are also known to play active roles in the immune systems of both animals and plants and are key signalling molecules, among many other important roles. Indeed, the latest research has shown that ROS/RNS play a much more complex and nuanced role in health and ageing than previously thought. Some of the most potentially profound therapeutic roles played by ROS and RNS in various medical interventions have emerged only in the last several years. Recent research suggests that ROS/RNS are significant and perhaps even central actors in the actions of antimicrobial and anti-parasite drugs, cancer therapies, wound healing therapies and therapies involving the cardiovascular system. Understanding the ways ROS/RNS act in established therapies may help guide future efforts in exploiting novel plasma medical therapies. The importance of ROS and RNS to plant biology has been relatively little appreciated in the plasma biomedicine community, but these species are just as important in plants. It appears that there are opportunities for useful applications of plasmas in this area as well.},

  abstract = {Absorption spectroscopy (AS) represents a reliable method for the characterization of cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets. The method’s simplicity stands out in comparison to competing diagnostic techniques. AS is an in situ , non-invasive technique giving absolute densities, free of calibration procedures, which other diagnostics, such as laser-induced fluorescence or optical emission spectroscopy, have to rely on. Ground state densities can be determined without the knowledge of the influence of collisional quenching. Therefore, absolute densities determined by absorption spectroscopy can be taken as calibration for other methods. In this paper, fundamentals of absorption spectroscopy are presented as an entrance to the topic. In the second part of the manuscript, a review of AS performed on cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets, as they are used e.g. in the field of plasma medicine, is presented. The focus is set on special techniques overcoming not only the drawback of spectrally overlapping absorbing species, but also the line-of-sight densities that AS usually provides or the necessity of sufficiently long absorption lengths. Where references are not available for measurements on cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets, other plasma sources including low-pressure plasmas are taken as an example to give suggestions for possible approaches. The final part is a table summarizing examples of absorption spectroscopic measurements on cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets. With this, the paper provides a ‘best practice’ guideline and gives a compendium of works by groups performing absorption spectroscopy on cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS, e.g. nitric oxide, NO) are well recognised for playing a dual role as both deleterious and beneficial species. \{ROS\} and \{RNS\} are normally generated by tightly regulated enzymes, such as \{NO\} synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. Overproduction of \{ROS\} (arising either from mitochondrial electron-transport chain or excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H) results in oxidative stress, a deleterious process that can be an important mediator of damage to cell structures, including lipids and membranes, proteins, and DNA. In contrast, beneficial effects of ROS/RNS (e.g. superoxide radical and nitric oxide) occur at low/moderate concentrations and involve physiological roles in cellular responses to noxia, as for example in defence against infectious agents, in the function of a number of cellular signalling pathways, and the induction of a mitogenic response. Ironically, various ROS-mediated actions in fact protect cells against ROS-induced oxidative stress and re-establish or maintain âredox balanceâ termed also âredox homeostasisâ. The âtwo-facedâ character of \{ROS\} is clearly substantiated. For example, a growing body of evidence shows that \{ROS\} within cells act as secondary messengers in intracellular signalling cascades which induce and maintain the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, however, \{ROS\} can also induce cellular senescence and apoptosis and can therefore function as anti-tumourigenic species. This review will describe the: (i) chemistry and biochemistry of ROS/RNS and sources of free radical generation; (ii) damage to DNA, to proteins, and to lipids by free radicals; (iii) role of antioxidants (e.g. glutathione) in the maintenance of cellular âredox homeostasisâ; (iv) overview of ROS-induced signaling pathways; (v) role of \{ROS\} in redox regulation of normal physiological functions, as well as (vi) role of \{ROS\} in pathophysiological implications of altered redox regulation (human diseases and ageing). Attention is focussed on the ROS/RNS-linked pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), rheumatoid arthritis, and ageing. Topics of current debate are also reviewed such as the question whether excessive formation of free radicals is a primary cause or a downstream consequence of tissue injury. },

  abstract = {Oxygen free radicals have been demonstrated to be important mediators of postischemic reperfusion injury in a broad variety of tissues; however, the cellular source of free radical generation is still unknown. In this study, electron paramagnetic resonance measurements with the spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) demonstrate that bovine endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation become potent generators of superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals. A prominent DMPO-OH signal aN = aH = 14.9 G is observed on reoxygenation after 45 min of anoxic incubation. Quantitative measurements of this free radical generation and the time course of radical generation are performed. Both superoxide dismutase and catalase totally abolish this radical signal, suggesting that O2 is sequentially reduced from O2-. to H2O2 to OH.. Addition of ethanol resulted in trapping of the ethoxy radical, further confirming the generation of OH.. Endothelial radical generation was shown to cause cell death, as evidenced by trypan blue uptake. Radical generation was partially inhibited and partially scavenged by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol. Marked inhibition of radical generation was observed with the potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol. These studies demonstrate that endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation, conditions observed in ischemic and reperfused tissues, generate a burst of superoxide-derived hydroxyl free radicals that in turn cause cell injury and cell death. Most of this free radical generation appears to be from the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Thus, endothelial cell free radical generation may be a central mechanism of cellular injury in postischemic tissues.},
